# q15

Three integers, randomly stored in a stack. Write a program, only use comparision once and one variable x, so that the largest value has probability 2/3 stored in x.

Answer:
```
x = S.pop()
if x < S.top():
    x = S.pop()
```

If the max value is on the top, or second top position, then it will be in variable x. Thus, 2/3 probability.
