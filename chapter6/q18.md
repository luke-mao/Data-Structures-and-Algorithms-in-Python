# q18

use the transfer function transfer(S, T) and two additional stacks,  
to reverse the elements in a stack.

Answer:
Assume the element is in stack A, and there are two additional empty stack B and C.
```
transfer(A, B)  # elements go to B, reverse order
transfer(B, C)  # elements go to C, original order
transfer(C, A)  # elements go back to A, original order.
