# q2

assume an initially empty stack has performed 25 push, 12 top and 10 pop operations, and it has trigged 3 stack empty mistake.
what is its current size?

answer:
both "top" and "pop" can trigger the stack empty exception.
although "top" does not add or remove elements, it can still trigger stack empty exception.

minimum = 25 - 10 = 15
example: top, top, top, push * 15, pop * 10, top * 9

maximum = 25 - (10 - 3) = 18
example: pop, pop, pop, push * 15, top * 12, pop * 7
