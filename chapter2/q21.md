#q21: problem with a very shallow inheritance chain
Code reuse !!!  
Whenever a large number of classes all extend from a single class, it is likely that you are missing out on potential code reuse from similar methods in different classes.   
There is likely some factoring of methods into common classes that could be done in this case, which would save programming and maintenance time, by eliminating duplicated code.
