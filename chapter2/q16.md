Prove the equation for the number of values in Range:
```
max(0, (stop-start+step-1)//step)
```

## proof:
First we need to know that the values form an arithmetic sequence:  
```
start, start+step, start+step*2, start+step*3 ...
```
So if, let us assume the final value "stop" is indeed in the sequence,  
then from maths:
```
stop = start + n * step
```
then we can deduce:
```
n = (stop - start) // step
```
This is the ideal equation, but in reality, the value **stop** is not included in the sequence, 
and the value **start** is included in the sequence,  
so we need modify the original equation
```
stop - step = start + (n-1) * step
where  
n - 1: we need to add 1 for the **start**  
stop - step: ideally this is the last number
```
The equation deduces to
```
n = (stop - start) / step + 1
  = (stop - start + step) / step
  = (stop - start + step - 1) // step
```
End of proof.
