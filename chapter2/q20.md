# q20: problem with a very large inheritance chain
There are two immediate inefficiencies:
1. the chaining of constructors implies a potentially long set of method calls any time an instance of a deep class, Z, is created  
2. the dynamic dispatch algorithm for determining which version of a certain method to use could end up looking through a large number of classes before it finds the right one to use
