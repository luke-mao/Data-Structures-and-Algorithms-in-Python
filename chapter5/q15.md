## Question

Consider the expansion method: increase list size from N to N + ceil(N // 4). prove that after amortization, the cost is still O(n)

## proof

Assume each insertion costs 1 token, and the expansion from N to N+N//4 costs k tokens. 
So now you want to expand from len=2^i to 2^i*(1+2^i//4) = 5/4*2^i = 0.5\*2^(i-1), so each insertion should have 0.5 token for future expansion. 

As a result, each insertion should cost 1.5 tokens, 1 for insertion, 0.5 for future growth.
