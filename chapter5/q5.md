# q5

## Textbook page 128

the original paragraph assumes that:

1. each normal insertion costs 1 token.  
2. during size increase from k to 2k, the initialization requires k tokens.

So considring the size increase from 2^i to 2^(i+1), the total extra cost for initialization is 1*2^i. So when you insert the last token, which is the (2^i_-1)th token, you need to have 1\*2^i = 2\*2^(i-1). i.e. two extra tokens for each insertion.  
So total 3 tokens for every insertion, 2 for future growth and 1 for insertion.

## q5 answer

So back to the question, now the doubling of size from k to 2k requires 3k tokens.  
Thus, the growth from 2^i to 2^(i+1) requires 3\*2^i tokens = 3\*2\*2^(i-1) = 6\*2^(i-1) tokens during the last insertion just before the expansion.  
As a result, you need 7 tokens during each insertion, 6 for future growth and 1 for insertion.
